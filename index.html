  <div class="entry-content"><p>We recently picked up a Rails application that was a few features away from completion. This application allows our <a href="https://www.artsy.net/about/the-art-genome-project">Genome Team</a> to classify multiple artworks based on visual and art historical characteristics. These characteristics, or &#8220;genes&#8221;, can be added, removed, and changed for any of the artworks on the panel.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3T2o2m2m3C1w/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-08%20at%2010.50.02%20AM.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>Our genomers are masters of efficiency, and over the years we have worked closely with them to tailor a dynamic interface to their specific workflow.</p>

<p>When we started working on the app, the back-end was organized, modular, and interfaced seamlessly with the Artsy API, but there were still a few front-end features we needed to implement before it could be used by the Genome Team. The app did not use a front-end framework, and as our features scaled it was difficult to keep track of UI state with pure CoffeeScript and global event listeners. Eventually, we decided to stop trying to patch our leaky roof and build a new one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Artsy has now grown past 100 team members and our Engineering organization is now 20 strong. For a brief overview of what the company has accomplished in the last two years, check out our <a href="http://2013.artsy.net">2013</a> and <a href="http://2014.artsy.net">2014</a> reviews.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to describe our updated technology stack. Last time <a href="/blog/2012/10/10/artsy-technology-stack">we did this</a> was when Artsy launched publicly in 2012.</p>

<center><img src='/images/2015-03-23-artsy-technology-stack-2015/stats.png'></center>


<p>Three years ago Artsy was a classic <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby-on-Rails</a> monolith with a handful of adjacent processes and tools. We&#8217;ve since broken it up into many independent services, and continue to heavily be a Ruby and JavaScript shop, using Rails where appropriate, with native code on mobile devices and some JVM-based experiments in micro-services.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We built CocoaPods-Keys as a way to remove API keys and secrets from our source code. We use it to open up our code to the pubic, without leaking private details. One of the cool things about doing it this way was that we could all use different API keys stashed away in each developers Keychain.</p>

<p>To ensure we could run CI on our apps we came up with two different ways to use keys on CI. This post explains them both.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">retrospective on Eidolon</a>, Artsy iOS codebases are often used as testbeds for new CocoaPods features. With Eidolon, we had the opportunity to try out CocoaPods&#8217; support for frameworks and Swift. This post is a look back at the month of using dependencies as dynamic frameworks instead of static libraries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The website is finally back up after crashing hard for 4 hours straight.</p>

<p>Recently AWS decided to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-maintenance-update">reboot a few of your servers for a critical update</a>. It didn&#8217;t seem like it was going to be a big deal, except that the schedule was only accommodating if you were in the Pacific Northwest. The first reboot took out a secondary replica of our MongoDB database. Unfortunately <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped/issues/321">the driver handled that poorly</a> and spent the first 400ms of every subsequent HTTP request trying to reconnect to the missing instance. That server came back up, but failed to find its storage volumes because of a human mistake in a past migration and the alerts were mistakenly silenced by someone monitoring the system. A few hours later the primary was being stepped down and rebooted, sending the driver into panic over <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped/issues/323">another bug</a>. The site went down.</p>

<p>None of this was obvious while it was happening as the rate of automated alerts grew. Engineers communicated to the team that they are actively focusing on bringing the systems back up. This helped to fend off a large amount of instant messages, e-mails, texts and phone calls from various people on the team that were in the middle of demoing something to a very important prospective customer on the other side of the planet. It was also the middle of the night in New York.</p>

<p>Now that all the systems are back up, lets write a detailed outage post-mortem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the Summer of 2014, we began developing a bidding kiosk for the Artsy auctions platform (code-named <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">Eidolon</a>). Typically, the iOS team here at Artsy worked on two main apps: a <a href="http://iphone.artsy.net">consumer-facing iPhone app</a> and an iPad app used by art galleries. For Eidolon, we followed <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/01/29/how-art-dot-sy-uses-github-to-build-art-dot-sy/">Artsyâ€™s standard practices</a> for building our software and use GitHub issues as our canonical source for bug reports and feature requests. Many of the components used in our apps are <a href="https://github.com/artsy">open source</a>, but the codebases themselves remain in private repositories.</p>

<p>Initial planning for Eidolon began over the Summer. Our designer <a href="http://twitter.com/katarinabatina">Katarina</a> had the main features sketched out. I was scheduled to work on it at first, with <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/1aurabrown">Laura</a> joining me near the end of the project. We had a rough scope: the app would be able to list artworks at an auction and allow prospective bidders to learn more about these artworks. The user would be able to register to bid and place bids using the Kiosk, including credit card processing for identity-checking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is about how, in a week, we switched from Solr to <a href="https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/72326?hl=en">Google Site Search</a> and customized it into a fast, <a href="https://artsy.net/search?q=banksy">beautiful search service</a>. Search is a difficult problem &#8211; a really difficult problem. For small companies and startups, the common solution to search is to launch a custom search service based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> or <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastic Search</a>. While these services are very appropriate for private data, we think Google Site Search should be considered in addition to these services for a public website. It is often not considered because users search on a dedicated site with different intent than they search Google. We found that while this may be true, it is not necessarily a good reason to roll your own search service for your public site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many established companies have bug bounty programs, including a recently publicized <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/09/10/bug-bounty-programs">Twitter Bug Bounty</a>. Some use services, such as <a href="https://hackerone.com">HackerOne</a> or <a href="https://bugcrowd.com">BugCrowd</a>. In early September 2014 we quietly launched <a href="https://artsy.net/security">our own Security Bug Bounty</a>. Since then we have fixed 14 issues reported by 15 security researchers and paid $750 in bounty. In the process we have learned a ton and wanted to share some things that would have probably done a little bit differently, knowing what we know now.</p>

<p>In this post I will focus on both technical and non-technical takeaways, and will provide an extensive list of vulnerabilities that should have been dealt with before launching our bug bounty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://artsy.net/imamuseum">Indianapolis Museum of Art</a> (IMA) recently shared thousands of high-resolution images from its permanent collection with Artsy, including 5,000 images that were in an un-cropped state. These images contain color swatches, frames, and diverse backgrounds, as shown below. The clutter in these images made them inappropriate to display to end users, and invited an approach to automatically crop the images. This post explores some fully automated techniques to locate the piece of art within each photo. If you&#8217;re eager to jump straight to the code that worked best, you&#8217;ll find the implementation of the &#8216;Rectangular Contour Search&#8217; section <a href="https://gist.github.com/ilyakava/b2dbca43991d6c668dbb">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2C0e2X1G1R1i1z1Y0M1B/banner.png" alt="All of these images are open access. For reference, the accession numbers/names. 45-115.tif 45-9-v01.tif 54-4.tif 76-166-1-12b.tif 14-57.tif" /></p>
