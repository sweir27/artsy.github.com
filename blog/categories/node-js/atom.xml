<p>At Artsy we've been building <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> applications that share code and rendering between the server and browser. We've seen many benefits from this -- pages load faster, we can optimize SEO, developers are more productive, and JavaScript coding is just an overall better experience.</p>

<p>Today we're happy to announce <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>, our open source boilerplate we use to bootstrap our Node projects and the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/benv">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/backbone-super-sync">node</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/sharify">modules</a> that built up to it.</p>

<p>In his article, <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-JavaScript-future-web-apps/"><em>Isomorphic JavaScript: The Future of Web Apps</em></a>, Spike Brehm from AirBnB describes this growing trend well and we're excited to be a part of it. In this article I'll tell Artsy's story of moving from a single monolithic application to modular <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> apps that run in Node and the browser and consume our external API.</p>

<h2>Growing Pains</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/rails-evolution.png" alt="Evolution of Artsy SOA Diagramm" /></p>

<p>Artsy started as a mostly standard <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> app almost three years ago. In these beginnings we were wildly productive and owe a lot of props to this great framework. However as time went on we started to deviate from the conventional Rails path until we were hardly leveraging much Rails at all. To support an early iOS app we used <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> to build an API. While building our API we wrote a lot of client-side JavaScript and soon integrated <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for organization. Eventually we cleanly separated our project into a single page Backbone app talking to our API all on inside of this original repository.</p>

<p>We knew we were outgrowing this monolithic project because we had some clear problems...</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow initial page loads because of lacking server-side rendering. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-twittercom">describes this problem well</a>.</li>
<li>Slow following client-side renders because of downloading large asset packages without clear ways to break them up.</li>
<li>SEO issues like building <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification">escaped fragment</a> pages in Ruby on the server while our users saw what JavaScript rendered on the client.</li>
<li>Maintaining duplicated Ruby/JavaScript code such as templates, date libraries, etc.</li>
<li>Very slow and brittle tests. We had a massive integration test suite consisting of over 3000 <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> tests that took hours to run because we lacked good JavaScript testing tools.</li>
<li>Poor mobile experience from trying to responsively scale down a large single page app with bloated and unused assets.</li>
<li>Slow asset compilation, server boot, and general build times. Productivity suffered greatly as more code was added to the same monolithic project.</li>
</ul>


<h2>There's Got to Be a Better Way</h2>

<p>A monolithic app that treats it's client-side code as a second class citizen was clearly not going to scale. Our poor mobile web experience was a good candidate to try something new. So we started building a separate mobile optimized website (m.artsy.net).</p>

<p>Some goals became clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better client-side tools from JavaScript testing to package managers.</li>
<li>Share rendering code server/client to reduce duplication and optimize initial page load.</li>
<li>Flexibility. We needed a way to divide our app into smaller chunks with smaller asset packages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Choosing Technology</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/tech.png" alt="Logos of Browserify, Express, and Backbone" /></p>

<p>Node was a clear choice because it made sharing rendering code server/client possible where other languages and frameworks struggle to do so. There were some existing Node projects that accomplish this such as <a href="http://derbyjs.com/">Derby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/rendr">Rendr</a>. However, adopting these had challenges of their own including being difficult to integrate with our API, learning unnecessary conventions, or being early prototypes with lacking documentation.</p>

<p>We wanted an approach that breaks our app into smaller, more flexible, pieces. Not all of Artsy needs to be a thick-client app, or even use much client-side JavaScript at all. Adopting an existing solution and combining most of the server and client into a shared abstraction seemed like an unnecessary black box. After trying many other frameworks we found a combination of lower-level tools to be a clear winner.</p>

<p>We open sourced this combination of tools and patterns into <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>. Ezel is a light-weight boilerplate project using <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for structure, and <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> to compose modules that can be shared server/client.</p>

<h2>Sharing and Rendering Server/Client</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/rendering.png" alt="Diagram of Server + Client Render" /></p>

<p>To share rendering code server/client we had to make sure our templates and objects being passed in to them could work the same server/client.</p>

<h3>Sharing Objects (Backbone Models)</h3>

<p><a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> lets you write modules that can run in Node or the browser. Since Backbone is able to be required on the server out of the box, it's easy to write models and collections that can be required on both sides with Browserify. However, there are two main speed bumps in doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Backbone uses AJAX for persistence.</p>

<p>We needed a Backbone.sync adapter that makes HTTP requests server-side, so we wrote one and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/backbone-super-sync">it's open sourced.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Data from the server needed to be shared in modules that are used server/client.</p>

<p>For instance, our API is an external URL stored in an environment variable. We needed to use this variable in a module that will be required on the server and the client with Browserify. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap">Bootstrapping data</a> is a common technique to share data from the server by embedding JavaScript in the initial HTML and exposing that data globally to the client. To avoid exposing globals we open sourced a tiny module called <a href="https://github.com/artsy/sharify">sharify</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Sharing Templates</h3>

<p>Browserify even lets you share non-JavaScript components server/client using <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#list-of-source-transforms">transforms</a>. To reuse our <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade</a> templates server/client it was a simple matter of using the <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/node-jadeify2">jadeify</a> transform.</p>

<h3>All Together Now</h3>

<p>With templates and models require-able server/client, sharing rendering code became much simpler. Below is an example using the same artwork model and detail template server/client.</p>

<p>Shared Backbone "Artwork" model to be required server/client:</p>

<p>``` javascript models/artwork.js
var Backbone = require('backbone'),
    API_URL = require('sharify').data.API_URL;</p>

<p>module.exports = Artwork = Backbone.Model.extend({</p>

<p>  url: API_URL + '/api/v1/artwork'</p>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Shared partial jade template used server/client:</p>

<p><code>jade templates/artwork-details.jade
h1= artwork.get('artist').name
h2= artwork.get('title')
</code></p>

<p>Full server-side page template including the partial:</p>

<p><code>jade templates/artwork-page.jade
doctype 5
html
  head
    title Artsy | #{artwork.get('title')}
  body
    include artwork-details
    != sharify.script()
</code></p>

<p>Route handler that uses the model server-side:</p>

<p>``` javascript app.js
//...
var Artwork = require('models/artwork.js');</p>

<p>app.get('/artwork/:id', function(req, res) {
  new Artwork({ id: req.params.id }).fetch({
    success: function(artwork) {
      // Boostrap artwork data into sharify
      res.locals.sharify.data.ARTWORK_JSON = artwork.toJSON();
      res.render('artwork-page', { artwork: artwork });
    }
  });
});
```</p>

<p>Client side code that requires the partial template and model:</p>

<p>``` javascript client.js
var Artwork = require('models/artwork.js'),
    ARTWORK_JSON = require('sharify').data.ARTWORK_JSON,
    detailsTemplate = require('templates/artwork-details.jade');</p>

<p>var artwork = new Artwork(ARTWORK_JSON);
artwork.on('change', function() {
  $('body').html(detailsTemplate({ artwork: artwork }));
});
```</p>

<h2>Developer Happiness</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/so-much-win.png" alt="Happy Developer Image" /></p>

<p>Not only does sharing code server/client let you easily optimize page rendering for fast page loads, but development becomes a lot nicer because we can reuse server-side JavaScript tools including...</p>

<h3>Package Managers</h3>

<p>With Browserify we were able to use npm as a package manager for server or client-side dependencies. There are <a href="http://bower.io/">other</a> <a href="http://component.io/">package</a> <a href="http://jamjs.org/">managers</a> for the client-side. However, because we were already using npm (and npm supports git urls), we could usually point to the project hosted on npm or Github without having to fork it.</p>

<p>For projects that don't support CommonJS modules (or npm), often one can still use npm and requires like so:</p>

<p><code>json
"devDependencies": {
  "zepto": "git://github.com/madrobby/zepto.git#c074a94f0f26dc946f1c501f5f45d603adada44d"
}
</code></p>

<p><code>javascript client.js
// Require the base Zepto library (attaches `Zepto` to window)
require('zepto/src/zepto.js');
// Attach Zepto's plugins
require('zepto/src/event.js');
require('zepto/src/detect.js');
// ....
</code></p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Testing is light-years ahead because you can test all of your code in Node headless. I wrote <a href="/blog/2013/06/14/writing-headless-backbone-tests-with-node-dot-js/">an article</a> on this a while back, and now with Browserify it's even better.</p>

<p>Models, templates, and other modules that are shared server/client can be required into <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">mocha</a> and tested server-side without extra effort. For more view-like client-side code that depends on DOM APIs, pre-rendered HTML, etc., we open sourced a library called <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/benv">benv</a> to help build a fake browser environment in Node for testing.</p>

<h3>Modularity</h3>

<p>We wanted to avoid a monolithic organization that groups code by type such as "stylesheets", "javascripts", "controllers", etc.. Not only is this a maintenance problem as it makes boundaries of your app unclear, but it also affects your users because it encourages grouping assets into large monolithic packages that take a long time to download.</p>

<p>Instead, we borrowed a page from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2472984/django-and-project-application-organization">Django</a> and broke up our project into smaller conceptual pieces called "apps" (small express sub-applications mounted into the main project) and "components" (portions of reusable UI such as a modal widget). This let us easily maintain decoupled segments of our project and build up smaller asset packages through Browserify's <code>require</code>s and <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/import.html">Stylus</a>' <code>import</code>s. For more details on how this is done please check out <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>, its <a href="https://github.com/artsy/ezel#project-vs-apps-vs-components">organization</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/ezel#asset-pipeline">asset pipeline</a> docs.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting, to avoid CSS spaghetti we followed a simple convention of name-spacing all of our classes/ids by the app or component name it was a part of. This was inspired by a <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/">blog post from Philip Walton</a>.</p>

<h2>Success!</h2>

<p>With this new architecture and set of Node tools we've seen enormous benefits compared to the pains of developing Backbone in a monolithic project with lacking JavaScript tools. Our mobile web experience is much better, we can render more content on the server for SEO and faster page loads, our test/build/deploy cycles went from hours to minutes, our developer on-boarding time went from days to minutes, and overall developer happiness has significantly improved.</p>

<p>It's an exciting time to be developing JavaScript apps and we will continue to open source our efforts wherever possible. Thanks and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

    <updated>2013-06-14T17:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/06/14/writing-headless-backbone-tests-with-node-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Write fast, headless, tests for Backbone using Node.js. See this project as an example  <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing">https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing</a>.</p>

<h2>A Brief History</h2>

<p>Artsy is mostly a thick client <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> app that sits on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and largely depends on <a href="http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/">Capybara</a> (<a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> backed bot that clicks around Firefox) for testing it's javascript. This leads to some seriously brittle and slow integration tests. <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/02/03/reliably-testing-asynchronous-ui-w-slash-rspec-and-capybara/">Despite being able to wrangle Capybara</a> to do most of our client-side testing, we knew there must be a better way.</p>

<p>When building a CMS app for our gallery partners to manage their Artsy inventory, we built a new Backbone app on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. The result was a headless test suite that runs around 60 times faster.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at how it's done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Setting Up The Environment</h2>

<p>The trick to testing client-side code in node.js is creating an environment that mimics the browser. <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">Jsdom</a> does just that by bringing a pure javascript implementation of the DOM to node.js.</p>

<p><code>javascript
jsdom.env({
  html: "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;",
  done: function(errs, window) {
    global.window = window;
    // ...
    callback();
  }
});
</code></p>

<p>At this point we've globally exposed the <code>window</code> object of our jsdom browser. However the DOM isn't the only global dependency in most of our client-side code. We'll also need to expose our common libraries like Backbone, Underscore, and jQuery.</p>

<p><code>javascript
global.window = window;
global.Backbone = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/backbone.js');
global.Underscore = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/underscore.js');
global.jQuery = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/jQuery.js');
</code></p>

<p>We can simply require Backbone, Underscore, and jQuery like any node module because they follow <a href="http://wiki.CommonJS.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1">CommonJS</a> convention. However not all libraries are CommonJS compatible, and in this case you might have to expose their attachment to <code>window</code>.</p>

<p><code>javascript
global.window = window;
require('../app/javascripts/vendor/zepto.js');
global.Zepto = window.Zepto;
</code></p>

<p>Finally you probably have a namespace like <code>App</code> which your components attach to.</p>

<p><code>javascript
global.window = window;
// Libraries
global.Backbone = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/backbone.js');
global.Underscore = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/underscore.js');
global.jQuery = require('../app/javascripts/vendor/jQuery.js');
// Namespace
global.App = {};
// We're ready to test some Backbone components
</code></p>

<p>Try to keep global dependencies to a minimum. This reduces setup/teardown, increases modularity, and makes it easier to test your code.</p>

<p>For example, instead of attaching a view to <code>App</code> it might be better to pass that view in to the options of another so you can call <code>this.options.header.doSomething()</code>.</p>

<h2>Unit Testing Models</h2>

<p>Because all good javascript guides are based off Todo apps, let's pretend we're testing a Todo model.</p>

<p>``` javascript
App.Todo = Backbone.Models.extend({</p>

<p>  urlRoot: '/api/todo',</p>

<p>  complete: function() {
    var self = this;
    $.ajax({
      url: '/api/todos/' + this.get('id') + '/complete',
      type: 'PUT',
      success: function() { self.set({ completed: true }); }
    });
  }
});
```</p>

<p>Let's test that <code>#complete</code> makes the proper API PUT and <code>completed</code> is updated to true. After we setup our jsdom environment we need to stub <code>$.ajax</code> using <a href="http://sinonjs.org/docs/#stubs">sinon</a> as we won't be sending XHRs in node.</p>

<p>``` javascript
before(function(done) {
  jsdom.env({
    html: "<html><body></body></html>",
    done: function(errs, window) {
      global.$ = require('../../app/javascripts/vendor/jquery.js');
      //...
    }
  });
});</p>

<p>beforeEach(function(done) {
  ajaxStub = sinon.stub($, 'ajax');
  todo = new App.Todo({ title: 'Feed the cat', id: 'feed-the-cat' });
});
```</p>

<p>Now we can simply assert that <code>$.ajax</code> was called with the right params and completed changed.</p>

<p>``` javascript
it('PUTs to the API', function() {
  todo.complete();
  $.ajax.args[0][0].type.should.equal('PUT');
  $.ajax.args[0][0].url.should
    .equal('/api/todos/feed-the-cat/complete');
});</p>

<p>it('updates the item to be completed', function() {
  todo.set('completed', false);
  $.ajax.args[0][0].success();
  todo.get('completed').should.equal(true);
});
```</p>

<h2>Unit Testing Views</h2>

<p>Models are easy to unit test because they're mostly self-contained javascript. However a Backbone view might expect some server-side rendered HTML, use client-side templates, communicate to other views, and so on. This makes it harder to test but manageable given our set up.</p>

<p>Let's pretend we have a view that renders our todo list inside a server-side rendered element, and uses a client-side template to fill in the actual list items.</p>

<p>Our DOM might look something like this:</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id='todos'>
  <h1>Things I need to do today</h1>
  <ul class='todos-list'></ul>
</div>


<pre><code>
and our view might look something like this:

``` javascript
App.TodosListView = Backbone.View.extend({

  el: '#todos',

  template: JST['todos/list_items'],

  initialize: function() {
    this.collection.bind('add remove', this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$('.todos-list')
      .html(this.template({ todos: this.collection.models }));
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>We can render the server-side <code>#todos</code> element by compiling the express view into html and injecting it straight in jsdom with our globally exposed jQuery.</p>

<p><code>javascript
filename = path.resolve(__dirname, '../app/views/index.jade');
template = fs.readFileSync(filename).toString();
html = jade.compile(template, { filename: filename })();
$('html').html(html);
</code></p>

<p>Next we need to expose our client-side templates. In this case I'm assuming client-side templates are pre-compiled into functions namespaced under a global JST object like in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rail's asset pipeline</a> (if you're looking for a node.js tool <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/nap">nap</a> is what Artsy uses).</p>

<p>We need to mimic what the JST functions are expecting so that when calling <code>JST['foo/bar']({ foo: 'some-data' })</code> we get back a string of html.</p>

<p><code>javascript
global.JST = {};
var filename = path.resolve(
  __dirname,
  '../app/javascripts/templates/todos/list.jade'
);
JST['todos/list'] = jade.compile(
  fs.readFileSync(filename).toString(),
  { filename: filename }
);
</code></p>

<p>With our server-side HTML injected and our client-side templates ready to use, all that's needed is to require any other dependent Backbone components. This boilerplate can get pretty repetitive and would be good to wrap up into a helper.</p>

<p>``` javascript
var clientenv = require('../helpers/clientenv');</p>

<p>before(function(done) {
  clientenv.setup(function() {
    global.App.Todo = require('../app/javascripts/models/todo.js');
    global.App.Todos = require('../app/javascripts/collections/todos.js');
    done();
  });
});</p>

<p>beforeEach(function(done) {
  var templateFilename = path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        '../../views/index.jade'
      ),
      html = require('jade').compile(
        fs.readFileSync(templateFilename).toString(),
        { filename: templateFilename }
      )();
  $('html').html(html);
  view = new App.TodosListView();
  done();
});</p>

<p>it('renders items as they are added', function() {
  view.collection.add([
    new App.Todo({ title: 'clean the kitchen' })
  ]);
  view.$el.html().should.include('clean the kitchen');
});
```</p>

<p>With a little bit more work, testing views in node can be almost as easy as testing models.</p>

<h2>Integration Tests</h2>

<p>Although I encourage writing way more unit test coverage as they're faster and less brittle, it is necessary to have integration tests to cover longer scenarios. At Artsy we use some tricks to make integration testing less painful.</p>

<h3>Stubbing the API Layer</h3>

<p>In Artsy's case we're consuming a JSON API service that already has ample test coverage, so it makes sense to cut off integration at this point and stub our API responses.</p>

<p>To do this we can conditionally check which environment we're running in and swap out the API to use a real API or an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> app serving a stubbed API.</p>

<p><code>javascript
if(app.get('env') == 'test') {
  app.set('api url', 'http://localhost:5000');
  // Create a mock api server in your test helpers
  // and run it on 5000 in a before block
} else {
  app.set('api url', 'http://api.my-app.com');
}
// Bootstrap in your server-side view so the client app
// knows where to point
app.locals.API_URL_ROOT = app.get('api url');
</code></p>

<p>If our API was hosted on the same server as our client app, or we're proxying API calls because of lack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing">CORS</a> support, this could be as easy as swapping out middleware.</p>

<p><code>javascript
if(app.get('env') == 'test') {
  app.use('/api', require('./test/helpers/mock_api'));
} else {
  app.use('/api', require('./routes/api'));
}
</code></p>

<p>This speeds up integration tests and simplifies the stack by not populating a database or booting an API server.</p>

<h3>Headless Integration Tests with Zombie.js</h3>

<p>Selenium has to actually boot up Firefox and poll the UI to wait for things to appear. This disconnect means extra seconds of "wait_util we're sure" time.  <a href="http://zombie.labnotes.org/">Zombie.js</a> is backed by our friend jsdom and alleviates these issues by giving us a fast headless browser that we can programmatically access.</p>

<p>Of course the caveat to headless testing is that you can't visually see how a test is actually failing. Using <code>{ debug: true }</code> in your options will spit every Zombie action to stdout. In most cases this is enough, but sometimes you need to go a step further and actually visualize what the test is doing.</p>

<p>A trick we use is to write tests using the browser's <code>jQuery</code>. This is more familiar than Zombie's DSL and lets you copy and paste test code directly in your browser's console to see if it's actually doing what you want.</p>

<p>.e.g</p>

<p>``` javascript
Browser.visit('http://localhost:5000', function(err, browser) {
  var $ = browser.window.$;</p>

<p>  // From here we can run <code>NODE_ENV=test node app.js</code> and copy
  // this code right into our browser's console.
  $('#add-todo').val('Foo').change();
  });
}
```</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using these techniques has greatly increased productivity and developer happiness for testing client-side code. For an example implementation of this see <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing">https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward, testing client-side code can be made even better by using a package manager that adds require functionality like <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/component/component">component</a>, or <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a>. But I've gone far enough for now, maybe in another blog post (leave a comment if you're interested).</p>
