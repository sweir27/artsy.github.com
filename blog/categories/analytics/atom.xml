    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In both my <a href="http://orta.github.com">personal apps</a> and Artsy Folio, I'm always after a deeper understanding of how people use the app. There's three ways to do this: ask users, watch users and track usage. I'd like to talk about the third of these.</p>

<p>We've experimented with quite a lot of analytics tools for the Artsy website, and it seemed fitting to do the same for our mobile app. We wanted the freedom to change the analytics tool without having to change the code, and so <a href="http://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">ARAnalytics</a> was born.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>ARAnalytics is the adaption of <a href="https://github.com/jkrall/analytical">Analytical</a> and  <a href="http://segmentio.github.com/analytics.js/">Analytics.js</a> to iOS. By using <a href="http://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a> it became possible to set up the entire analytics stack with only a few lines of code in your <code>Podfile</code>.</p>

<p><code>ruby
  pod "ARAnalytics/Crashlytics"
  pod "ARAnalytics/Mixpanel"
</code></p>

<p>The list of supported libraries is pretty vast ( <em>TestFlight, Mixpanel, Localytics, Flurry, Google Analytics, KISSMetrics, Countly, Crittercism, Bugsnag and Crashlytics</em> ) and the API for <code>ARAnalytics</code> tries to bridge any gaps it can find in the implementations.</p>

<p><code>ARAnalytics</code> simplifies the API to two main parts of tracking; user details and events. User details are things like your internal ID for a user, and custom properties like your app's preferences, whilst events are temporal actions that are triggered based off user actions.</p>

<p>There is another tool worth mentioning and that is <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/dosets/Analytics/0.0.5/">Analytics</a> which is a new port of Analytics.js which does a similar <em>simple API to different analytics providers</em> but works by offloading the work to the server. I think there are advantages and disadvantages to both of these approaches, but I think one or the other should cover nearly all use cases!</p>

<p>ARAnalytics is available on Github at <a href="http://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">orta/ARAnalytics</a> and documented on <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ARAnalytics/1.2/">Cocoadocs</a> (which Artsy proudly sponsors!)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why do so many companies write a homegrown pageviews tracking system? Between Google Analytics, Kissmetrics and many others, isn't that a completely solved problem?</p>

<p>These popular solutions lack domain knowledge. They are easily capable of segmenting users by region or browser, but they fail to recognize rules core to your business. Tracking pageviews with a homegrown system becomes your next sprint's goal.</p>

<p>Implementing a hit counter service is quite tricky. This is a write-heavy, asynchronous problem that must minimize impact on page rendering time, while dealing with rapidly growing amounts of data. Is there a middle ground between using Google Analytics and rolling out our own homegrown implementation? How can we use Google Analytics for data collection and inject domain knowledge into gathered data, incrementally, without writing our own service?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let's write a Rake task that pulls data from Google Analytics. We can run it daily. Start with a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/garb">Garb</a>.</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem "garb", "0.9.1"
</code></p>

<p>Garb requires Google Analytics credentials. Those can go into a YAML configuration file, which will use environment settings in production (it's an ERB template, too). We can hardcode the test account values.</p>

<p>``` yaml config/google_analytics.yml
defaults: &amp;defaults</p>

<p>development, test:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  email: "ga@example.com"
  password: "password"
  ua: "UA-12345678-1"</p>

<p>production:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  email: &lt;%= ENV['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_EMAIL'] %>
  password: &lt;%= ENV['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PASSWORD'] %>
  ua: &lt;%= ENV['GOOGLE_ANALYICS_UA'] %>
```</p>

<p>Establish a Google Analytics session and fetch the profile corresponding to the Google user account with Garb.</p>

<p><code>ruby
config = YAML.load(ERB.new(File.new(Rails.root.join("config/google_analytics.yml")).read).result)[Rails.env].symbolize_keys
Garb::Session.login(config[:email], config[:password])
profile = Garb::Management::Profile.all.detect { |p| p.web_property_id == config[:ua] }
raise "missing profile #{config[:ua]} in #{Garb::Management::Profile.all.map(&amp;:web_property_id)}" unless profile
</code></p>

<p>Garbs needs a data model to collect pageviews. It extends <code>Garb::Model</code> and defines a set of "metrics" and "dimensions".</p>

<p><code>ruby app/models/google_analytics_pageviews.rb
class GoogleAnalyticsPageviews
  extend Garb::Model
  metrics :pageviews
  dimensions :page_path
end
</code></p>

<p>You can play with the <a href="http://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/explorer/">Google Analytics Query Explorer</a> to see the many possible metrics (such as pageviews) and dimensions (such as requested page path).</p>

<p>By default, Google Analytics lets clients retrieve 1000 records in a single request. To get all records we can add an iterator, called <code>all</code>, that will keep making requests until the server runs out of data. The code for <em>config/initializers/garb_model.rb</em> is <a href="https://gist.github.com/2265877">in this gist</a> and I made a <a href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/garb/pull/116">pull request</a> into Garb if you'd rather merge that onto your fork.</p>

<p>The majority of our pages are in the form of "/model/id", for example "/artwork/leonardo-mona-lisa". We're interested in all pageviews for a given artwork and in pageviews for a given artist, at a given date. We'll store selected Google Analytics data in a <code>GoogleAnalyticsPageviewsRecord</code> model described further.</p>

<p><code>ruby
t = Date.today - 1
GoogleAnalyticsPageviews.all(profile, { :start_date =&gt; t, :end_date =&gt; t }) do |row|
  model = /^\/#\!\/(?&lt;type&gt;[a-z-]+)\/(?&lt;id&gt;[a-z-]+)$/.match(row.page_path)
  next unless (model[:type] == "artwork" || model[:type] == "artist")
  GoogleAnalyticsPageviewsRecord.create!({
    :model_type =&gt; model[:type],
    :model_id =&gt; model[:id],
    :pageviews =&gt; row.pageviews,
    :dt =&gt; t.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  })
end
</code></p>

<p>Each <code>GoogleAnalyticsPageviewsRecord</code> contains the total pageviews for a given model ID at a given date. We now have a record for each artwork and artist. We can rollup existing data into a set of collections, incrementally. For example, <code>google_analytics_artworks_monthly</code> will contain the monthly hits for each artwork.</p>

<p>``` ruby
class GoogleAnalyticsPageviewsRecord
  include Mongoid::Document</p>

<p>  field :model_type, type: String
  field :model_id, type: String
  field :pageviews, type: Integer
  field :dt, type: Date</p>

<p>  index [
    [:model_type, Mongo::ASCENDING],
    [:model_id, Mongo::ASCENDING],
    [:dt, Mongo::DESCENDING]
  ], :unique => true</p>

<p>  after_create :rollup</p>

<p>  def rollup
    Mongoid.master.collection("google_analytics<em>#{self.model_type}s_total").update(
      { :model_id => self.model_id },
      { "$inc" => { "count" => self.pageviews }}, { :upsert => true })
    {
      :daily => self.dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
      :weekly => self.dt.beginning_of_week.strftime("%Y-%W"),
      :monthly => self.dt.beginning_of_month.strftime("%Y-%m"),
      :yearly => self.dt.beginning_of_year.strftime("%Y")
    }.each_pair do |t, dt|
      Mongoid.master.collection("google_analytics</em>#{self.model_type}s_#{t}").update(
        { :model_id => self.model_id, :dt => dt },
        { "$inc" => { "count" => self.pageviews }}, { :upsert => true })
    end
  end</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>The rollup lets us query these tables directly. For example, the following query returns a record with the pageviews for the Leonardo's "Mona Lisa" in January 2012.</p>

<p><code>ruby
Mongoid.master.collection("google_analytics_artworks_monthly").find_one({
  :model_type =&gt; "artwork", :model_id =&gt; "leonardo-mona-lisa", :dt =&gt; "2012/01"
})
</code></p>

<p>One of the obvious advantages of pulling Google Analytics data is the low volume of requests and offline processing. We're letting Google Analytics do the hard work of collecting data for us in real time and are consuming its API without the performance or time pressures.</p>
