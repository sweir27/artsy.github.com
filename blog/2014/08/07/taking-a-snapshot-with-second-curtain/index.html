<div class="entry-content"><p>At Artsy, we try hard to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/orta/getting-eigen-out?slide=35">test</a>
our iOS applications to ensure that we avoid regressions and have a clearly
defined spec of how our apps should look and behave. One of the core pieces of
our testing setup is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case">FBSnapshotTestCase</a>,
a library written by Facebook to compare views at runtime with images of those
views that are known to be correct. If the images differ, the test fails. We
also use <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been noticing a friction between the developers on the iOS team
and the tools we&#8217;re using to test our apps: while Travis allows us to easily
access the logs of test runs, it can only indicate that a snapshot test failed,
not why it failed. That&#8217;s because the images that are compared are locked on
Travis&#8217; machine – we cannot access those images, so we can&#8217;t see the
differences. This is <em>really</em> promblematic when the tests pass locally but fail
only on Travis.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> and I were discussing this
problem and we came up with a potential solution. Since the images were stored
on disk on Travis&#8217; machine, why not just upload them somewhere we <em>can</em> see
them? Like an S3 bucket. We could even generate a basic HTML page showing you
the different test failures.</p>

<p>Time passed and, later on, I had tests passing locally but failing on Travis.
I saw an opportunity to build something new. I&#8217;m not a proficient Ruby developer,
but I enjoy learning new things, so I decided to create a Ruby gem that could
fit within our existing testing pipeline. A lot of the structure for the code
came from an existing gem we already use with Travis, <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty">xcpretty</a>.
With an example of how gems that support iOS testing are written, I was on my
way to creating my own.</p>

<p>At first, things were very difficult. While I had contributed small patches to
existing Ruby projects before, I had never created a brand new one from scratch.
The existing <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">guides</a> were very
helpful, and I found help from the CocoaPods developers when I had questions
about things like the arcane semantics of Ruby&#8217;s <code>require</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had a working proof-of-concept. Everything seemed ready to go, and
I prepared to incorporate my new tool, which I called <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain">Second Curtain</a>,
into my pull request on the Artsy repo. But there was a problem.</p>

<p>Second Curtain relies on environment variables to get access to the S3 bucket
where it stores the images. I planned on using Travis&#8217; system to <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/">encrypt</a>
those credentials. It turns out, for very good reasons, encrypted environment
variables are not available on pull requests created on forks of repositories.
This is a problem because of the way that <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/01/29/how-art-dot-sy-uses-github-to-build-art-dot-sy/">Artsy uses GitHub</a>.
While it&#8217;s not a problem for a closed-source repository to have (restrictive)
access to an S3 bucket, it would be irresponsible to expose S3 credentials for
an open-source project. I&#8217;m <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain/issues/5">working</a>
on a solution.</p>

<p>Orta helped with the design aspect of the tool; while uploading the images was
sufficient, we could make the process of seeing the differences between the two
images even easier. He created a <a href="https://eigen-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/snapshots/2014-08-04--15-47/index.html">HTML page</a>
that would allow developers to see the before-and-after versions by moving their
mouse cursor over the different images.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.ashfurrow.com/github/second_curtain.png" alt="Image Diff" /></p>

<p>In the end, I got Second Curtain to work with Artsy&#8217;s iOS repository and I
discovered the discrepency between the two images: due to a timezone difference
between my computer and Travis&#8217;, a date was being formatted differently. Not a
difficult thing to fix, but not something I would have ever been able to
discover had I not been able to see the images side-by-side.</p>

<p>So after all that, one line of Objective-C was changed and the tests passed – my
pull request was merged. I learnt a lot about how Ruby developers structure
their code and what tools they use to write software. While I&#8217;m happy to return
to iOS apps for a while, it was a great experience and I&#8217;m hoping to bring some
of the ideas I discovered writing Ruby back to Objective-C.</p>
